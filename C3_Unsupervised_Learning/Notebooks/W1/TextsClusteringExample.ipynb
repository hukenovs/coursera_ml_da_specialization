They are every 10 pixels or so, and seem\\nto be affected somewhat by opening windows and pulling down menus.\\nIt looks to a semi-technical person like there is a loose connection\\nbetween the screen and the rest of the computer.\\n\\nI am open to suggestions that do not involve buying a new computer,\\nor taking this one to the shop.  I would also like to not have\\nto buy one of Larry Pina\\'s books.  I like Larry, but I\\'m not sure\\nI feel strongly enough about the computer to buy a service manual\\nfor it.\\n\\nOn a related note:  what does the monitor connector connect to?\\n\\nErik\\n\\n'"
